"The Painter" Lyrics, by Deep Purple


Painter
Come colour up my life

Oh painter

Come colour up my life

Take away the misery

Take away the strife

Writer

Make me up a play

Writer

Make the meaning gay

v1 For I don't need a poem - v2 Oh I don't need a podium

Just give me words to say

Singer

Let me sing a song

Singer

Let me sing a song

You don't have to worry, singer

Cause singer you can sing along
